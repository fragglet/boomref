<h1>HTML Boom reference</h1>

This page is an HTML version of the <tt>boomref.txt</tt> file that was
included with the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Boom">Boom</a>
source port. It documents the extended editing facilities that Boom
adds for level authors, which today forms
<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:Boom_compatible">a common
standard</a> that is supported by most Doom source ports.
<p>
I dedicate this page to the memory of
<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Jim_Flynn">James F. Flynn</a> (jff)
who authored some parts of it and implemented many of the generalized linedef
and sector types which are described below. If you're mapping for Boom,
please spare a thought for Jim and the work he did on Boom.
<p>
I have deliberately preserved the form of the original text file. The text
is from the version of <tt>boomref.txt</tt> included with Boom 2.02, the
last release of Boom. However, it includes an additional section from the
<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF">MBF</a> version of <tt>boomref.txt</tt>
that documents the <a href="#ld271">type 271 and type 272</a> linedefs that
were added for that port. There's also a separate page with an
<a href="mbfedit.html">interactive version of mbfedit.txt</a> that documents
the features of that port in more detail.
<p>
The document has been reformatted so that most of the text uses a proportional
font, for readability. If you prefer to read in the original fixed-width font,
<a href="#" onclick="toggleProportional();">click here</a>.
<p>
If you prefer, you can just read <a href="boomref.txt">the original
boomref.txt</a> without any of the additions here.
<p>
The purpose of this document was originally to be a linkable form of
<tt>boomref.txt</tt> so that I could cross-reference it from the following
video of
<a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/TeamTNT/boom/boomedit">
<tt>boomedit.wad</tt></a>, a demo WAD that was made to demonstrate most of
the main features of Boom.
However, the scope has since grown and this document now includes some
interactive features - specifically it includes pop-up
<a href="calc.html">JavaScript calculators</a> for calculating
<a href="#sec13">generalized linedef types</a>. Hopefully these may be
of help to level authors creating Boom-compatible WAD files.

<p>
In <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Boom">BOOM</a> actions are caused to happen thru <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type">linedef types</a>.
BOOM has three kinds of linedef types:
</p>
<pre>
Regular     - the linedef types that were already in DOOM II v1.9

Extended    - linedef types not in DOOM II v1.9 but less than 8192 
              in value

<a href="#sec13">Generalized</a> - linedef types over 8192 in value that contain bit
              fields that independently control the actions of the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sector</a>
              affected.</pre>
<p>
A <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef">linedef</a> with non-zero linedef type is called a linedef trigger. A
linedef trigger is always activated in one of three ways - pushing on
the first <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sidedef">sidedef</a> of the linedef, walking over the linedef, or
shooting the linedef with an impact weapon (fists, chainsaw, pistol,
shotgun, double barreled, or chaingun).
</p>
<p>
Linedefs activated by pushing on them come in two varieties. A manual
linedef affects the sector on the second sidedef of the line pushed.
A switched linedef affects all sectors that have the same tag field
as the linedef that was pushed.
</p>
<p>
Nearly all switched, walkover, and gun linedefs operate on the sectors
with the same tag as that in the tag field of the linedef.
</p>
<p>
Some linedefs are never activated per se, but simply create or control
an effect thru their existence and properties, usually affecting the 
sectors sharing the linedef's tags. There are also a few special case
like line-line teleporters and exit linedefs that do not affect
sectors.
</p>
<p>
Some linedefs are only triggerable once, others are triggerable as
many times as you like.
</p>
<p>
Triggering types are denoted by the letters P, S, W, and G for
manual(push), switched, walkover, and gun. Their retriggerability is
denoted by a 1 or R following the letter. So the triggering types for
linedefs are:
</p>
<pre>
P1 PR S1 SR W1 WR G1 GR
</pre>
<p>
Often linedef actions depend on values in neighboring sectors. A
neighboring sector is one that shares a linedef in common, just
sharing a vertex is not sufficient.
</p>
<p>
In DOOM only one action on a sector could occur at a time. BOOM
supports one floor action, one ceiling action, and one lighting
action simultaneously.

  insertWikiFloat("Door", "doors");
</script>
<p>
A <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Door">door</a> is a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sector</a>, usually placed between two rooms, whose ceiling
raises to open, and lowers to close. 
</p>
<p>
A door is fully closed when its ceiling height is equal to its floor
height. 
</p>
<p>
A door is fully open when its ceiling height is 4 less than the lowest
neighbor ceiling adjacent to it. 
</p>
<p>
A door may be set to an intermediate state initially, or thru the action
of a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef">linedef</a> trigger that affects ceilings or floors. The door is passable
to a player when its ceiling is at least 56 units higher than its floor.
In general the door is passable to a monster or a thing when its ceiling
is at least the monster or thing's height above the floor.
</p>
<p>
If a door has a ceiling height ABOVE the fully open height, then an
open door action moves the ceiling to the fully open height
instantly.
</p>
<p>
If a door has a ceiling height BELOW the fully closed height (that is
the ceiling of the door sector is lower than the floor of the door
sector) a close door action moves the ceiling to the fully closed
height instantly.

<p>
A door can be triggered by pushing on it, walking over or pressing a
<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef">linedef</a> trigger tagged to it, or shooting a linedef tagged to it.
These are called manual, walkover, switched, or gun doors resp.
</p>
<script language="javascript">
  insertVideoFloat(VIDEO_BOOMEDIT_WAD, "door-activated lighting", "3m19s");
</script>
<p>
Since a push door (P1/PR) has no use for its tag, BOOM has extended
the functionality to include changing any tagged <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sectors</a> to maximum
neighbor lighting on fully opening, then to minimum neighbor lighting
on fully closing. This is true for regular, extended, and generalized
doors with push triggers.
</p>
<p>
A door trigger can be locked. This means that the door function will only
operate if the player is in possession of the right key(s). Regular
and extended door triggers only care if the player has a key of the
right color, they do not care which. Generalized door triggers
can distinguish between skull and card keys, and can also require
any key, or all keys in order to activate.
</p>
<p>
A door can have different speeds, slow, normal, fast or turbo.
</p>
<p>
A door can wait for different amounts of time.
</p>
<p>
A door may or may not be activatable by monsters.
</p>
<p>
Any door function except Close and Stay Closed, when closing and
encountering a monster or player's head will bounce harmlessly off
that head and return to fully open. A Close and Stay Closed will rest
on the head until it leaves the door sector.

There are two generalized door linedef types, Generalized Door, and
Generalized Locked Door. The following tables show the possibilities
for each parameter, any combination of parameters is allowed:

<p>
Slow and Fast represent the same speeds as slow and fast regular doors. Normal
is twice as fast as slow, Fast is twice normal, Turbo is twice Fast.

Lowest Neighbor Floor (LnF)
</p>
<p>
This means that the floor moves to the height of the lowest
neighboring floor including the floor itself. If the floor
direction is up (only possible with generalized floors) motion is
instant, else at the floor's speed.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Next Neighbor Floor (NnF)
</p>
<p>
This means that the floor moves up to the height of the lowest
adjacent floor greater in height than the current, or down to the
height of the highest adjacent floor less in height than the current,
as determined by the floor's direction. Instant motion is not
possible in this case. If no such floor exists, the floor does not move.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Lowest Neighbor Ceiling (LnC)
</p>
<p>
This means that the floor height changes to the height of the lowest
ceiling possessed by any neighboring <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sector</a>, including that floor's
ceiling. If the target height is in the opposite direction to floor
motion, motion is instant, otherwise at the floor action's speed.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
8 Under Lowest Neighbor Ceiling (8uLnC)
</p>
<p>
This means that the floor height changes to 8 less than the height
of the lowest ceiling possessed by any neighboring sector, including
that floor's ceiling. If the target height is in the opposite
direction to floor motion, motion is instant, otherwise at the floor
action's speed.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Highest Neighbor Floor (HnF)
</p>
<p>
This means that the floor height changes to the height of the highest
neighboring floor, excluding the floor itself. If no neighbor floor
exists, the floor moves down to -32000. If the target height is in
the opposite direction to floor motion, the motion is instant,
otherwise it occurs at the floor action's speed.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
8 Above Highest Neighbor Floor (8aHnF)
</p>
<p>
This means that the floor height changes to 8 above the height of
the highest neighboring floor, excluding the floor itself. If no
neighbor floor exists, the floor moves down to -31992. If the target
height is in the opposite direction to floor motion, the motion is
instant, otherwise it occurs at the floor action's speed.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Ceiling
</p>
<p>
The floor moves up until its at ceiling height, instantly if floor
direction is down (only available with generalized types), at the
floor speed if the direction is up.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
24 Units (24)
</p>
<p>
The floor moves 24 units in the floor action's direction. Instant
motion is not possible with this linedef type.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
32 Units (32)
</p>
<p>
The floor moves 32 units in the floor action's direction. Instant
motion is not possible with this linedef type.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
512 Units (512)
</p>
<p>
The floor moves 512 units in the floor action's direction. Instant
motion is not possible with this linedef type.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Shortest Lower Texture (SLT)
</p>
<p>
The floor moves the height of the shortest lower texture on the
boundary of the sector, in the floor direction. Instant motion is not
possible with this type. In the case that there is no surrounding
texture the motion is to -32000 or +32000 depending on direction.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
None
</p>
<p>
Some pure texture type changes are provided for changing the floor
texture and/or sector type without moving the floor.

<p>
A floor can be activated by pushing on a linedef bounding it
(generalized types only), or by pushing on a switch with the same tag
as the floor <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sector</a>, or by walking over a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef">linedef</a> with the same tag
as the floor, or by shooting a linedef with the same tag as the
floor with an impact weapon.
</p>
<p>
A floor can move either Up or Down.
</p>
<p>
A floor can move with speeds of Slow, Normal, Fast, or Turbo. If the
target height specified by the floor function (see Floor Targets
above) is in the opposite direction to the floor's motion, then
travel is instantaneous, otherwise its at the speed specified.
</p>
<p>
A floor action can be a texture change type, in which case after the
action the floor texture of the affected floor, and possibly the
sector type of the affected floor are changed to those of a model
sector. The sector type may be zeroed instead of copied from the
model, or not changed at all. These change types are referred to
below as Tx (texture only), Tx0 (type zeroed), and TxTy (texture and
type changed). The model sector for the change may be the sector on
the first <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sidedef">sidedef</a> of the trigger (trigger model) or the sector with
floor at destination height across the lowest numbered two-sided
linedef surrounding the affected sector (numeric model). If no model
sector exists, no change occurs. If a change occurs, floor texture is
always affected, lighting is never affected, even that corresponding
to the sector's type, nor is any other sector property other than the
sector's type.
</p>
<p>
Numeric model algorithm:
</p>
<p breakable="true">
1) Find all floors adjacent to the tagged floor at destination height<br>
2) Find the lowest numbered linedef separating those floors from that tagged<br>
3) The sector on the other side of that linedef is the model
</p>
<p>
A floor action can have the crush property, in which case players and
monsters are crushed when the floor tries to move above the point
where they fit exactly underneath the ceiling. This means they take
damage until they die, leave the sector, or the floor action is stopped.
A floor action never reverses on encountering an obstacle, even if
the crush property is not true, the floor merely remains in the same
position until the obstacle is removed or dies, then continues.

A ceiling action can have the crush property (generalized types only),

<p>
A <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Lift">platform</a> is basically a floor action involving two heights. The
simple raise platform actions, for example, differ from the
corresponding floor actions in that if they encounter an obstacle,
they reverse direction and return to their former height.
</p>
<p>
The most often used kind of platform is a lift which travels from its
current height to the target height, then waits a specified time and
returns to it former height.

<p class="l3-header">
Lowest Neighbor Floor
</p>
<p>
This means that the platforms "low" height is the height of the
lowest surrounding floor, including the platform itself. The "high"
height is the original height of the floor.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Next Lowest Neighbor Floor
</p>
<p>
This means that the platforms "low" height is the height of the
highest surrounding floor lower than the floor itself. If no lower
floor exists, no motion occurs as the "low" and "high" heights are
then both equal to the floors current height.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Lowest Neighbor Ceiling
</p>
<p>
This means that the platforms "low" height is the height of the
lowest surrounding ceiling unless this is higher than the floor
itself. If no adjacent ceiling exists, or is higher than the floor no
motion occurs as the "low" and "high" heights are then both equal to
the floors current height.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Lowest and Highest Floor
</p>
<p>
This target sets the "low" height to the lowest neighboring floor,
including the floor itself, and the "high" height to the highest
neighboring floor, including the floor itself. When this target is
used the floor moves perpetually between the two heights. Once
triggered this type of linedef runs permanently, even if the motion
is temporarily suspended with a Stop type. No other floor action can
be commanded on the sector after this type is begun.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Ceiling
</p>
<p>
This target sets the "high" height to the ceiling of the sector and
the "low" height to the floor height of the sector and is only used in
the instant toggle type that switches the floor between the ceiling
and its original height on each activation. This is also the ONLY
instant platform type.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Raise Next Floor
</p>
<p>
This means that the "high" height is the lowest surrounding floor
higher than the platform. If no higher adjacent floor exists no
motion will occur.
</p>
<p class="l3-header">
Raise 24 Units
</p>
<p>
The "low" height is the original floor height, the "high" height is 24
more. 
</p>
<p class="l3-header">

</p>
<p>
The "low" height is the original floor height, the "high" height is 32

<p>
A platform can be activated by pushing on a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef">linedef</a> bounding it
(generalized types only), or by pushing on a switch with the same tag
as the platform <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sector</a>, or by walking over a linedef with the same tag
as the platform, or by shooting a linedef with the same tag as the
platform with an impact weapon.
</p>
<p>
A platform can move with speeds of Slow, Normal, Fast, or Turbo. 
Only the instant toggle platform moves instantly, all others move at
the platform's speed.
</p>
<p>
A platform can have a delay, in between when it reaches "high" height
and returns to "low" height, or at both ends of the motion in the
case of perpetual lifts.
</p>
<p>
A platform action can be a texture change type, in which case after
the action the floor texture of the affected floor, and possibly the
sector type of the affected floor are changed to those of a model
sector. The sector type may be zeroed instead of copied from the
model, or not changed at all. These change types are referred to
below as Tx (texture only), Tx0 (type zeroed), and TxTy (texture and
type changed). The model sector for the change is always the sector
on the first <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sidedef">sidedef</a> of the trigger (trigger model).  If a change
occurs, floor texture is always affected, lighting is never affected,
even that corresponding to the sector's type, nor is any other sector
property other than the sector's type.

A <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Crushing_ceiling">crusher ceiling</a> is a linedef type that causes the ceiling to cycle

monsters and players that happen to be in between. <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Barrel">Barrels</a> explode
when crushed.
</p>
<p>

A crusher can be activated by pushing on a linedef bounding it

crusher with an impact weapon (generalized types only).
</p>
<p>
A crusher has a speed: slow, normal, fast, or turbo. The slower the
speed, the more damage the crusher does when crushing, simply thru
being applied longer. When a slow or normal crusher is moving down
and encounters something to crush, it slows down even more, by a
factor of 8. This persists until it reaches bottom of stroke and
starts up again. Fast and turbo crushers do not slow down.
</p>
<p>
A crusher can be silent. The regular silent crusher makes platform
stop and start noises at top and bottom of stroke. The generalized
silent crusher is completely quiet.
</p>
<p>
A crusher linedef is provided to stop a crusher in its current
position. Care should be used that this doesn't lock the player out
of an area of the wad if the crusher is too low to pass. A crusher
can be restarted, but not changed, with any crusher linedef.

<p>
A <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type#Stair_builders">stair builder</a> is a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type">linedef type</a> that sets a sequence of <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sectors</a>
defined by a complex rule to an ascending or descending sequence of
heights.
</p>
<p>
The rule for stair building is as follows:
</p>
<p>
1) The first step to rise or fall is the tagged sector. It rises or
falls by the stair stepsize, at the stair speed, in the stair
direction..
</p>
<p>
2) To find the next step (sector) affected examine each two-sided
<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef">linedef</a> with first <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sidedef">sidedef</a> facing into the previous step in numerical
order. For each such linedef if the sector on the other side is
already active, or has already risen from this stair, the linedef is
skipped. If textures are not ignored then any linedef with a
different floor texture on its second side is also skipped. The next step
to rise is the sector on the other side of the first linedef not
skipped. If none exists, stair building ceases.
</p>
<p>
The next step moves to the height of the previous step plus or minus 
the stepsize depending on the direction the stairs build, up or down. 
If the motion is in the same direction as the stairs build, it occurs
at stair build speed, otherwise it is instant.
</p>
<p>
3) Repeat step 2 until stair building ceases.
</p>
<pre>
<span class="fixed-only">----------------------------------------</span>
<a class="l2-header" name="sec6.1" href="#sec6.1">Section 6.1 Varieties of Stair Builders</a>

<p>
A stair can be activated by pushing on a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef">linedef</a> bounding it
(generalized types only), or by pushing on a switch with the same tag

as the stair, or by shooting a linedef with the same tag as the
stair with an impact weapon (generalized types only).
</p>
<p>
Only extended and generalized stair types are retriggerable. The
extended retriggerable stairs are mostly useless, though triggering a
stair with stepsize 8 twice might be used. The generalized
retriggerable stairs alternate building up and down on each
activation which is much more useful.
</p>
<p>
A stair can build up or down (generalized types only).
</p>
<p>
A stair can have a step size of 4, 8, 16, or 24. Only generalized
types support stepsize of 4 or 24.
</p>
<p>
A stair can have build speeds of slow, normal, fast or turbo. Only
generalized types support speeds of normal or turbo.
</p>
<p>
A stair can stop on encountering a different texture or ignore
(generalized types only) different textures and continue.
</p>
<p>
Only the regular build fast, stepsize 16 stair has the property that
monsters and players can be crushed by the motion, all others do not
crush.

An exit <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type">linedef type</a> ends the current level bringing up the
intermission screen with its report of kills/items/secrets or frags
in the case of deathmatch. Obviously, none are retriggerable, and

<p>
An exit can be activated by pushing on a switch with the exit type
or  by walking over a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef">linedef</a> with the exit type, or by shooting a

</p>
<script language="javascript">

</script>
<p>
An exit can be normal or secret. The normal exit simply ends the
level and takes you to the next level via the intermission screen. A
secret exit only works in a special level depending on the IWAD being
played. In DOOM the secret exits can be on E1M3, E2M5, or E3M6. In
DOOM II they can be in levels 15 and 31. If a secret exit is used in
any other level, it brings you back to the start of the current
level. In DOOM the secret exits go from E1M3 to E1M9, E2M5 to E2M9,
and E3M6 to E3M9. In DOOM II they go from 15 to 31 and from 31 to 32.
In DOOM II a normal exit from 31 or 32 goes to level 16.

</script>
<p>
A <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Teleporter">teleporter</a> is a linedef that when crossed or switched makes the
player or monster appear elsewhere in the level. There are only
regular and extended teleporters, no generalized teleporters exist
(yet).  Teleporters are the only direction sensitive walkover
triggers in DOOM (to allow them to be exited without teleporting
again). They must be crossed from the first <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sidedef">sidedef</a> side in order to
work.
</p>
<script language="javascript">
  insertVideoFloat(VIDEO_BOOMEDIT_WAD, "silent teleporters", "3m30s");
</script>
<p>
The place that the player or monster appears is set in one of two
ways. The more common is by a teleport thing in the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sector</a> tagged to
the teleport line. The newer completely player preserving line-line
silent teleport makes the player appear relative to the exit line
(identified by having the same tag as the entry line) with the same
orientation, position, momentum and height that they had relative to
the entry line just before teleportation. A special kind of line-line
teleporter is also provided that reverses the player's orientation by
180 degrees.
</p>
<p>
In the case of several lines tagged the same as the teleport line, or
several sectors tagged the same, or several teleport things in the
tagged sector, in all cases the lowest numbered one is used.
</p>
<p>
In DOOM crossing a W1 teleport line in the wrong direction used it
up, and it was never activatable. In BOOM this is not the case, it
does not teleport but remains active until next crossed in the right
direction.
</p>
<p>
If the exit of a teleporter is blocked a monster (or anything besides
a player) will not teleport thru it. However if the exit of teleporter
is blocked a player will, including into a down crusher, a monster,
or another player. In the latter two cases the monster/player
occupying the spot dies messily, and this is called a telefrag.

A teleporter can be walkover or switched, and retriggerable or not.
</p>
<p>
A teleporter can have destination set by a teleport thing in the
tagged <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sector</a>, or by a line tagged the same as the teleport line.
These are called thing teleporters and line teleporters resp.
</p>
<p>
A teleporter can preserve orientation or set orientation from the
position, height, and angle of the teleport thing. Note a thing
destination teleporter always sets position, though it may preserve
orientation otherwise.
</p>
<p>
A teleporter can produce green fog and a whoosh noise, or it can be
silent, in which case it does neither.
</p>
<p>
A teleporter can transport monsters only, or both players and
monsters.

<p>
A donut is a very specialized <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type">linedef type</a> that lowers a pillar in a
surrounding pool, while raising the pool and changing its texture and
type.
</p>
<p>
The tagged <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sector</a> is the pillar, and its lowest numbered line must be
two-sided. The sector on the other side of that is the pool. The pool
must have a two-sided line whose second <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sidedef">sidedef</a> does not adjoin the
pillar, and the sector on the second side of the lowest numbered such
<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef">linedef</a> is the model for the pool's texture change. The model sector
floor also provides the destination height both for lowering the
pillar and raising the pool.
</p>
<p>
No generalized donut linedefs exist, and all are switched or
walkover.

Used to make 2s normal textures translucent. If tag==0, then this linedef's

translucency filter instead of the default TRANMAP, allowing different

This allows the tagged sector to have two levels -- an actual floor and

sector on the first sidedef of the linedef. Typical use is "deep water" that
can be over the player's head.

Boom sectors controlled by a 242 linedef are partitioned into 3 spaces.
The viewer's xyz coordinates uniquely determine which space they are in.

<script language="javascript">

</script>
<p>
If they are in space B (normal space), then the floor and ceiling textures
and lightlevel from the real sector are used, and the colormap from the 242
linedef's first sidedef's normal texture is used (COLORMAP is used if it's
invalid or missing). The floor and ceiling are rendered at the control
sector's heights.
</p>
<p>
If they are in space C ("underwater"), then the floor and ceiling textures
and lightlevel from the control sector are used, and the lower texture in
the 242 linedef's first sidedef is used as the colormap.
</p>
<p>
If they are in space A ("head over ceiling"), then the floor and ceiling
textures and lightlevel from the control sector are used, and the upper
texture in the 242 linedef's first sidedef is used as the colormap.
</p>
<p>
If only two of these adjacent partitions in z-space are used, such as 
underwater and normal space, one has complete control over floor textures,
ceiling textures, light level, and colormaps, in each of the two partitions.
The control sector determines the textures and lighting in the more "unusual"
case (e.g. underwater).
</p>
<p>
It's also possible for the fake floor to extend below the real floor, in
which case an invisible platform / stair effect is created. In that case,
the picture looks like this (barring any ceiling effects too):
</p>
<pre>
     ----------------------------------  &lt; real sector's ceiling texture
    |   real ceiling = fake ceiling    |
    |                                  |
    |                                  |
    |              B                   | &lt; real sector's lightlevel
    |                                  | &lt; normal texture's colormap
    |                                  |
    |          real floor              |
     ----------------------------------  &lt; invisible, no texture drawn
    |                                  |
    |                                  |
    |                                  | &lt; real sector's lightlevel
    |              C                   | &lt; normal texture's colormap
    |                                  |
    |                                  |
    |          fake floor              | &lt; real sector's floor texture
     ----------------------------------  &lt; fake sector's floor height
</pre>
<p>
In this case, since the viewer is always at or above the fake floor, no
colormap/lighting/texture changes occur -- the fake floor just gets drawn
at the control sector's height, but at the real sector's lighting and
texture, while objects stand on the higher height of the real floor.
</p>
<p>
It's the viewer's position relative to the fake floor and/or fake ceiling,
which determines whether the control sector's lighting and textures should
be used, and which colormap should be used. If the viewer is always between
the fake floor and fake ceiling, then no colormap, lighting, or texture
changes occur, and the view just sees the real sector's textures and light
level drawn at possibly different heights.
</p>
<p>
If the viewer is below the fake floor height set by the control sector, or is
above the fake ceiling height set by the control sector, then the corresponding
colormap is used (lower or upper texture name), and the textures and lighting
are taken from the control sector rather than the real sector. They are still
stacked vertically in standard order -- the control sector's ceiling is always
drawn above the viewer, and the control sector's floor is always drawn below
the viewer.
</p>
<p>
The kaleidescope effect only occurs when F_SKY1 is used as the control sector's
floor or ceiling. If F_SKY1 is used as the control sector's ceiling texture,
then under water, only the control sector's floor appears, but it "envelops"
the viewer. Similarly, if F_SKY1 is used as the control sector's floor texture,
then when the player's head is over a fake ceiling, the control sector's
ceiling is used throughout.
</p>
<p>
F_SKY1 causes <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Hall_of_mirrors_effect">HOM</a> when used as a fake ceiling between the viewer and normal
space. Since there is no other good use for it, this kaleidescope is an
option turned on by F_SKY1. Note that this does not preclude the use of sky
REAL ceilings over deep water -- this is the control sector's ceiling, the
one displayed when the viewer is underwater, not the real one.
</p>
<p>
A colormap has the same size and format as Doom's <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/COLORMAP">COLORMAP</a>. Extra colormaps
may defined in Boom by adding them between C_START and C_END markers in wads.
Colormaps between C_START and C_END are automatically merged by Boom with any
previously defined colormaps.

WATERMAP is a colormap predefined by Boom which can be used to provide a

<p>
The length of the linedef with type 223 controls the amount of friction
experienced by the player in the tagged sector, when in contact with the
floor. Lengths less than 100 are sticker than normal, lengths greater than
<a name="ld100" href="#ld100">100</a> are slipperier than normal. The effect is only present in the tagged
sector when its friction enable bit (<a href="#sec15-bit8">bit 8</a>) in the sector type is set.
This allows the flat to be changed in conjunction with turning the effect
on or off thru texture/type changes.

<p>
These linedefs transfer wall textures to skies. F_SKY1 must still be used as
the floor or ceiling texture in the sectors for which sky is desired, but the
presence of a 271 or 272 property-transfer linedef can change the sky texture
to something other than a level-based default.
</p>
<p>
Every sector with F_SKY1 floor or ceiling which shares the same sector tag
as the 271 or 272 linedef will use a sky texture based on the upper texture
of the first sidedef in the 271 or 272 linedef. Sectors with F_SKY1 floors or
ceilings which are not tagged with 271 or 272 linedefs, behave just like Doom.
</p>
<p>
Horizontal offsets or scrolling in the transferred texture, is converted into
rotation of the sky texture. Vertical offsets or scrolling is transferred as
well, allowing for precise adjustments of sky position. Unpegging in the sky
transfer linedef does not affect the sky texture.
</p>
<p>
Horizontal scrolling of the transferred upper wall texture is converted into
rotation of the sky texture, but it occurs at a very slow speed relative to
the moving texture, allowing for long-period rotations (such as one complete
revolution per Doom real-time hour).
</p>
<p>
Effects other than sky-transfer effects are not excluded from the affected
sector(s), and tags can be shared so long as the effects are unambiguous. 
For example, a wall-scrolling linedef can share a sector tag with both its
affectee linedef (the one being scrolled), and with the sector that the
latter controls. There is no ambiguity because one effect (scrolling) applies
to a linedef, while the other effect (sky transfer) applies to a sector.
</p>
<p>
If a sector underneath a special sky needs to be set up to have a different
purpose (for example, if it is a lift or a stairbuilder), then two tags will
need to be created, and the transfer linedef and any scrolling linedefs will
need to be duplicated as well, so that the same effect as far as the sky goes,
is duplicated in two separate sector tags. This will not affect sky appearance,
but it will allow a special sector which needs a unique tag, to sit under such
a sky.
</p>
<p>
Animated textures may be transferred to skies as well.
</p>
<p>
In Doom, skies were flipped horizontally. To maintain compatibility with this
practice, the 272 linedef flips the wall image horizontally. The 271 linedef
does not flip the wall image, and it is intended to make it easier to take
existing non-flipped wall textures and transfer them to skies.
</p>
<p>
Sky textures which are different must be separated by non-sky textures, or
else the results are undefined.

The previous implementation of these was SECTOR-SPECIFIC. The new

circular area whose center is defined by a Thing of type <a href="#p5">5001 (push)

Things. A new linedef type of 226 is used to control the effect, and this
line should be tagged to the sector with the 5001/5002 Thing.
</p>
<p>
The length of the linedef defines the 'full' magnitude of the force, and
the force is inversely proportional to distance from the point source. If
the length of the controlling linedef is L, then the force is reduced to
zero at a distance of 2L.

<p>
The most basic kind of scrolling linedef causes some part of the tagged
<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector">sector</a> or tagged wall to scroll, in proportion to the length of the
linedef the trigger is on, and according to the direction that trigger
linedef lies. For each 32 units of length of the trigger, the tagged
object scrolls 1 unit per frame. Since the length of a linedef doesn't
change during gameplay, these types are static, the scrolling effect
remains constant during gameplay. However, these effects can be combined
with, and/or canceled by, other scrollers.
</p>

<p>
Walls with the same tag as the linedef trigger scroll at the same
rate as a floor or ceiling controlled by one of 250-253, allowing
their motion to be synchronized. When the linedef trigger is not
parallel to the wall, the component of the linedef in the direction
perpendicular to the wall causes the wall to scroll vertically. The

For simplicity, a static scroller is provided that scrolls the first

<p class="l3-header">
Dynamic Scrolling
</p>
<p>
To achieve dynamic scrolling effects, the position or rate of scrolling
is controlled by the relative position of the floor and ceiling of the
sector on the scrolling trigger's first <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sidedef">sidedef</a>. The direction of
scrolling remains controlled by the direction of the linedef trigger.
Either the floor or ceiling may move in the controlling sector, or
both. The control variable is the amount of change in the sum of the
floor and ceiling heights.
</p>
<p>
All scroll effects are additive, and thus two or more effects may
reinforce and/or cancel each other.

<script language="javascript">
  insertVideoFloat(VIDEO_BOOMEDIT_WAD, "displacement scrollers", "0m16s");
</script>
<p>
In the first kind, displacement scrolling, the position of the scrolled
objects or walls changes proportionally to the motion of the floor or
ceiling in the sector on the first <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sidedef">sidedef</a> of the scrolling trigger. 
The proportionality is set by the length of the linedef trigger. If it
is 32 units long, the wall, floor, ceiling, or object moves 1 unit for
each unit the floor or ceiling of the controlling sector moves. If it
is 64 long, they move 2 units per unit of relative floor/ceiling motion
in the controlling sector and so on.

<pre>
<a name="ld245" href="#ld245">245</a>    -- Scroll Tagged Ceiling w.r.t. 1st Side's Sector 
</pre>
<p>
The tagged sector's ceiling texture scrolls in the direction of the
scrolling trigger line, when the sector on the trigger's first sidedef
changes height. The amount moved is the height change times the trigger
length, divided by 32. Objects attached to the ceiling do not move.

<p>
The tagged sector's floor texture scrolls in the direction of the

The tagged sector's floor texture, and objects on the floor, move in

<p>
Walls with the same tag as the linedef trigger scroll at the same
rate as a floor or ceiling controlled by one of 245-249, allowing
their motion to be synchronized. When the linedef trigger is not
parallel to the wall, the component of the linedef in the direction
perpendicular to the wall causes the wall to scroll vertically. The
length of the component parallel to the wall sets the horizontal
scroll displacement, the length of the component perpendicular to
the wall sets the vertical scroll displacement. The distance scrolled
is the controlling sector's height change times the trigger length,
divided by 32.

</pre>
<script language="javascript">
  insertVideoFloat(VIDEO_BOOMEDIT_WAD, "accelerative scrollers", "0m42s");
</script>
<p>
The second kind of dynamic scrollers, accelerative scrollers, also
react to height changes in the sector on the first <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sidedef">sidedef</a> of the
linedef trigger, but the RATE of scrolling changes, not the
displacement. That is, changing the controlling sector's height
speeds up or slows down the scrolling by the change in height
times the trigger's length, divided by 32. 
</p>
<p>
An on/off scroller can be made by using an accelerative scroller
and any linedef that changes the controlling sector's heights.
If a scroll effect which is initially on is desired, then the
accelerative scroller should be combined with a static one which
turns the scroll effect on initially. The accelerative scroller
would then need to be set up to cancel the static scroller's
effect when the controlling sector's height changes.

if the ceiling is motionless originally, the linedef trigger is 32

Walls with the same tag as the linedef trigger increase their 
scroll rate in sync with a floor or ceiling controlled by one of
214-217. When the linedef trigger is not parallel to the wall, the 
component of the linedef in the direction perpendicular to the wall 
causes the wall to increase its vertical scroll rate. The length of 
the component parallel to the wall sets the change in horizontal
scroll rate, the length of the component perpendicular to the wall
sets the change in vertical scroll rate. The rate change is the height
change times the trigger length, divided by 32.

</span></pre>
<p>
BOOM has added generalized <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type">linedef types</a> that permit the parameters
of linedef actions to be nearly independently chosen. 
</p>
<p>
To support these, <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DETH">DETH</a> has been modified to support them via dialogs
for each generalized type; each dialog allows the parameters for
that type to be independently specified by choice from a array of
radio buttons. A parser has also been added to support reading back
the function of a generalized linedef from its type number.
</p>
<p>
NOTE to wad authors:
</p>
<p>
This requires a lot of type numbers, 20608 in all so far. Some
editors may object to the presence of these new types thru assuming
that a lookup table of size 256 suffices (or some other reason). For
those that must continue to use such an editor, it may be necessary
to stick to the old linedef types, which are still present.
</p>
<script language="javascript">
  insertInfoFloat("TRIGCALC.EXE is mentioned here; the pop-up calculators "+
                  "on this page perform the same function.");
</script>
<p>
We are also providing command line tools to set these linedef types,
independent of which editor you happen to use, but they are a lot
less slick, and more difficult to use than DETH. See TRIGCALC.EXE and
CLED.EXE in the <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/TeamTNT/boom/editutil">EDITUTIL.ZIP</a> package of the BOOM distribution.

The following sections define the placement and meaning of the bit
fields within each linedef category. Fields in the description are
listed in increasing numeric order.
</p>
<p>
Some nomenclature:
</p>
<p>
Target height designations:
</p>
<p>
H means highest, L means lowest, N means next, F means floor, C means
ceiling, n means neighbor, Cr means crush, sT means shortest
lower texture. 
</p>
<p>
Texture change designations:
</p>
<p>
c0n  change texture, change sector type to 0, numeric model change
c0t  change texture, change sector type to 0, trigger model change
cTn  change texture only, numeric model change
cTt  change texture only, trigger model change
cSn  change texture and sector type to model's, numeric model change
cSt  change texture and sector type to model's, trigger model change
</p>
<p>
A trigger model change uses the sector on the first side of the
trigger for its model. A numeric model change looks at the sectors
adjoining the tagged sector at the target height, and chooses the one
across the lowest numbered two sided line for its model. If no model
exists, no change occurs. Note that in DOOM II v1.9, no model meant
an illegal sector type was generated.

1) When change is nochg, model is 1 when monsters can activate trigger
   otherwise monsters cannot activate it.
2) The change fields mean the following:
   nochg   - means no texture change or type change
   zero    - means sector type is zeroed, texture copied from model
   txtonly - means sector type unchanged, texture copied from model
   type    - means sector type and floor texture are copied from model
3) down/up specifies the "normal" direction for moving. If the
   target specifies motion in the opposite direction, motion is instant.
   Otherwise it occurs at speed specified by speed field.
4) Speed is 1/2/4/8 units per tic
5) If change is nonzero then model determines which sector is copied.
   If model is 0 its the sector on the first side of the trigger.
   if model is 1 (numeric) then the model sector is the sector at
   destination height on the opposite side of the lowest numbered
   two sided linedef around the tagged sector. If it doesn't exist
   no change occurs.

BOOM is backward compatible with DOOM's <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector_type">sector types</a>. All types 0-17
have the same meaning they did under DOOM. Types 18-31 are reserved
for extended sector types, that work like DOOM's and share the
limitation that only one type can be active in a sector at once. No
extended sector types are implemented at this time.

From Matt Fell's <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Unofficial_Doom_Specs">Unofficial DOOM Spec</a> the DOOM sector types are:
</p>
<pre>
Dec Hex Class   Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 0  00  -       Normal, no special characteristic.
 1  01  Light   random off
 2  02  Light   blink 0.5 second
 3  03  Light   blink 1.0 second
 4  04  Both    -10/20% health AND light blink 0.5 second
 5  05  Damage  -5/10% health
 7  07  Damage  -2/5% health
 8  08  Light   oscillates
 9  09  Secret  a player must stand in this sector to get credit for
                  finding this secret. This is for the SECRETS ratio
                  on inter-level screens.
10  0a  Door    30 seconds after level start, ceiling closes like a door.
11  0b  End     -10/20% health. If a player's health is lowered to less
                  than 11% while standing here, then the level ends! Play
                  proceeds to the next level. If it is a final level
                  (levels 8 in DOOM 1, level 30 in DOOM 2), the game ends!
12  0c  Light   blink 0.5 second, synchronized
13  0d  Light   blink 1.0 second, synchronized
14  0e  Door    300 seconds after level start, ceiling opens like a door.
16  10  Damage  -10/20% health

17  11  Light   flickers on and off randomly

Note that BOOM will NEVER exit the game on an illegal sector type, as
was the case with DOOM. The sector type will merely be ignored.

BOOM also provides generalized <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector_type">sector types</a>, based on bit fields,
that allow several sector type properties to be independently
specified for a sector. Texture change linedefs can be used to switch
some or all of these properties dynamically, outside lighting.
</p>
<p>
Bits 0 thru 4 specify the lighting type in the sector, the same codes
that DOOM used are employed:
</p>

Only one new <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_flag">linedef flag</a> is implemented, called PassThru, which
allows a push or switch linedef trigger to pass the push action thru
it to ones within range behind it. In this way BOOM is capable of
setting off many actions with a single push. Note that the limitation
of one floor action, one ceiling action, and one lighting action per
sector affected still applies however.

BOOM supports resources embedded in the .EXE that are loaded before
all other resources. They can be replaced by resources of the same
name in the IWAD or add-on PWADs. These resources can be extracted

You can then extract the resources from predef.wad to alter them for

<p>
<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SWITCHES">SWITCHES</a> format:
</p>
<p>
The SWITCHES lump makes the names of the switch textures used in the
game known to the engine. It consists of a list of records each 20
bytes long, terminated by an entry (not used) whose last 2 bytes are 0.
</p>
<pre>
9 bytes        Null terminated string naming "off" state texture for switch
9 bytes        Null terminated string naming "on" state texture for switch
2 bytes        Short integer for the IWADs switch will work in
                1=shareware
                2=registered/retail DOOM or shareware
                3=DOOM II, registered/retail DOOM, or shareware
                0=terminates list of known switches
</pre>
<p>
<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ANIMATED">ANIMATED</a> format:
</p>
<p>
The ANIMATED lump makes the names of the animated flats and textures
known to the engine. It consists of a list of records, each 23 bytes
long, terminated by a record (not used) whose first byte is -1 (255).
</p>
<pre>
1 byte         -1 to terminate list, 0 if a flat, 1 if a texture
9 bytes        Null terminated string naming last texture/flat in animation
9 bytes        Null terminated string naming first texture/flat in animation
4 bytes        Animation speed, number of frames between animation changes
</pre>
<p>
The utility package contains a program, SWANTBLS.EXE that will
generate both the SWITCHES and ANIMATED lumps from a text file. An
example is provided, DEFSWANI.DAT that generates the standard set of
switches and animations for DOOM.

<script language="javascript">
  insertIllustrationFloat("watermap.png",
                          "The WATERMAP colormap as it appears in use.");
</script>
<p>
The WATERMAP lump has the same format as COLORMAP, 34 tables of 256
bytes each, see the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Unofficial_Doom_Specs">UDS</a> for details. Note that colormaps you add to
a PWAD must be between C_START and C_END markers.
</p>
<p>
The utility package contains a program, CMAPTOOL.EXE, that will
generate custom colormaps for use with BOOM. It also includes 7
premade colormaps, and an add-on wad containing them.

<span class="l3-header">Color translation tables</span>
<span class="fixed-only">------------------------</span>
CRBRICK        Translates red range to brick red
CRTAN          Translates red range to tan
CRGRAY         Translates red range to gray
CRGREEN        Translates red range to green
CRBROWN        Translates red range to brown
CRGOLD         Translates red range to dark yellow
CRRED          Translates red range to red range (no change)
CRBLUE         Translates red range to light blue
CRBLUE2        Translates red range to dark blue (status bar numerals)
CRORANGE       Translates red range to orange
CRYELLOW       Translates red range to light yellow
</pre>
<p>
These tables are used to translate the red font characters to other
colors. They are made replaceable in order to support custom palettes
in TC's better. Note however that the font character graphics must
be defined using the palette indices for the standard red range of the
palette 176-191.
